CHANGES (summary of recent visual and structural improvements)

Date: 2025-10-08

Files changed
- css/style.css
  - Added Google Fonts (Playfair Display + Inter)
  - Refined color palette to warm/gold tones and softer background
  - Updated navbar: subtler gradient, improved spacing, rounded login pill
  - Improved hero: larger typography, soft shadow, rounded bottom corners
  - Product cards: larger images, refined shadow, softer rounded corners
  - Buttons updated for a luxury look (rounded, subtle hover lifts)
  - Modals and footer updated with refined spacing, shadows and border radii

What to check locally
1. Serve the project root via an HTTP server (module imports need http).
   - Example (from project root):
     python -m http.server 8000
   - Open: http://localhost:8000
2. Inspect the homepage visually: hero background, navigation, product cards, and buttons should appear with the new fonts and palette.
3. Open DevTools > Console and verify no errors are logged from `js/script.js`.

Notes and next steps
- I focused on purely visual CSS improvements that don't change HTML structure or JavaScript behavior.
- If you'd like a more custom logo, hover animations, or a mobile-friendly hamburger menu, tell me and I can implement it next.
- After you validate in-browser, I can iterate on details (type sizes, spacing, or color tweaks) based on your taste.

- Additional updates (standardization across pages):
  - Added design tokens (font sizes, button sizes, label color, input tokens) to `css/style.css`.
  - Introduced utility classes: `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.label`, `.text-muted`.
  - Updated `css/auth.css` and `css/product-detail.css` to use the shared tokens and button utilities.
  - Replaced many page-level CSS `var(--primary-color)` usages with `var(--primary-900)` for a consistent active UI color and used `--accent-color` for hover accents.
  - Updated HTML (e.g., `pages/product-detail.html`, `index.html`) and `js/script.js` so interactive buttons use the standardized classes while preserving existing JS `id`s and behaviors.

How to continue testing:
1. Serve the site and review the homepage plus several inner pages (product detail, categories, auth pages).
2. Verify interactive elements (add to cart, wishlist, filters) still function and their styles match the new tokens.
3. Tell me which pages you'd like me to further tune (mobile menu, logo placement, or color variants).
